Merchants hawk their wares, children chase pigeons, and townsfolk hurry about their business. The aroma of freshly baked bread mixes with the scent of livestock from the nearby pens. The weapon shop, 'The Armory', stands prominently on the north side of the square. Its windows are filled with an impressive display of arms and armor. Shops selling everything from tools to textiles line the square, bustling with activity.",
